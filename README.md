# imagepad
Resize, convert to desired format and pad images transparently or with the specified color background for use in websites to prevent uneven image displays for images with differing aspect ratios when using with responsive frameworks like bootstrap etc.

It has two components 
1. Python function to convert pad images, which can be imported in python code to resize images on the fly as uploaded by the users to a website.
2. Tk Gui to batch convert multiple images at a time.

TODO: add ability to run imgagepad from cli to convert images.
